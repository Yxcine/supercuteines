    <h1>To My Dearest Princess</h1>
    <p>
      Hey Angel,

I’ve been sitting here, thinking about you, there’s just so much on my heart right now. I hope you’ll take a moment to read this, because it’s coming straight from me. No filters, no fancy words. Just honesty.

First, I want to say I’m sorry. From the bottom of my heart, I really am. I know I messed up, and I know I hurt you and that’s something I never wanted to do. It breaks my heart that I made you feel that way. I don’t have any excuses. All I can say is I’m human, and I made a mistake. But I’m learning. I’m growing. And I promise you that I’m going to do better.

You mean so much to me. More than I think I’ve ever said out loud. And the last thing I want is for anything I’ve done to make you doubt that. You mean so much to me. More than I think I’ve ever said out loud. And the last thing I want is for anything I’ve done to make you doubt that. I just really enjoy being around you, you bring something into my life that I didnt' even know I needed. You’re the person who helps me breathe a lil easier when things get tough.

Thank you for being patient with me, for loving me even when I didn’t make it easy, for believing in us when I lost my way. I don’t take any of that for granted. Every moment with you even the quiet ones where we’re just sitting in the same class not saying much they stay with me. You stay with me. And I’m so grateful for you. Every single day.

I want to be the person you can count on, not just when things are good, but when life gets messy too. I don’t want to repeat the same mistakes. I’m not perfect, but I swear to you, I’m trying. And I’ll keep trying, every day, to show you with my actions how much you mean to me.

I care about you so much, and I really hope, with time, I can earn back your trust and remind you why we’re worth holding on to.
    </p>
